ZTP for Factory Workflow provides a way for installing on top of {product-title} the required pieces that will enable it to be used as a disconnected Hub Cluster and able to deploy Edge-cluster Clusters that will be configured as the last step of the installation as disconnected too.

Using OpenShift Container Agnostic Topology Integrated Chassis (OCATOPIC) to deploy ZTP for Factory Workflow, the whole procedure is managed and controlled end-to-end.

In this document, we'll cover the procedure and the automation around the different products and components that are involved in the ZTP for Factory workflow and orchestrated by OCATOPIC for a successful load deployment.

This repository contains the scripts and OpenShift Pipelines definitions used to configure a provided OpenShift cluster (reachable via `KUBECONFIG`) for use with the ZTP for Factory.

The pipeline will then cover several aspects:

- Create required components (ACM, Registry, etc...)
- Deploy and mirror a Registry with all required images and operators
- Configure ACM to provision the edgeclusters (based on the `edgeclusters.yaml` file) cluster and deploy all required components on it.
- Deploy Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) components
- etc...

The pipeline has two parts:

- One that deploys the HUB cluster configuration (based on existing requirements, like OCP deployed with ODF and volumes created)
- Another that deploys Edge-cluster clusters based on the configuration `edgeclusters.yaml` file using a HUB cluster configured with the previous pipeline.

The actual workflow and its details can be checked at the files inside the `pipelines` folder.
